The present code is distributed under GNU licence v03.
This code is presented as is, no guarantee whatsoever.

The Code is intended to help establish the Center of Mass of disjoint components
in a CSD representation of Neural Electrophysiological Activity.

The basic functions are in pure text files, with ending ".jl" and the worked
examples and more complex uses, including graphics, are in Jupyter Notebooks, endings
in ".ipynb". 

Some help is written as comments or documenting strings ("docstrings") in the
files themselves.

The notebook called dCSDAyCMapartirdeBRWfile.ipynb includes a complete worked
example from the raw data.

All tools necessary to obtain the CSD are in a separate repository.
(https://github.com/kzapfe/CSDA). Here we include all necesary functions to obtain
the Center of Mass and to obtain trajectories from them.

Contents is as follows:

 - The functions for Center of Mass are in CentrosdeMasa.jl
 - The functions for trayectories are in FunctionsTrajectories.jl 
 - Center_of_Mass_workedExample.ipynb contains a fully worked example.
 - Trajectories.jl contains a minimal example.
