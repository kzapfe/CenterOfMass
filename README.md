This code is presented as is, no guarantee whatsovever.

The Code is intended to help establish the Center of Mass of disjoint components
in a CSD representation of Neural Activity.

The basic functions are in pure text files, with ending ".jl" and the worked
examples and more complex uses, including graphics, are in Jupyter Notebooks, endings
in ".ipynb". 

Some help is written as comments or documenting strings ("docstrings") in the
files themselves.

The present code is distributed under GNU licence type II.

The notebook called dCSDAyCMapartirdeBRWfile.ipynb includes a complete worked
example from the raw data, presented in Spanish.
